# scripts-portable

Single-file scripts designed to be dropped into other projects to provide utility.

## Items in this folder

- fileselectcli
  - A minimal file selection utility inspired by ranger on Linux. Intended to
work in any terminal for quick file selection.
- csvreader
  - A set of helper utilities for quickly previewing and importing data
from csvs. I drop this into projects where I'll be working with a lot of csv data
