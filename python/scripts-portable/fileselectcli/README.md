# fileselectcli

A simple, light file explorer written in Python. Provides a more visual way for a
user to select a file during application runtime

## TODOs

- Commenting overall
- Restrict inputs in two main ways
  - Disallow inputs of indices outside of current listdir output
  - Distinguish between files and folders in cases such as moving into a directory
- Provide a visual distinction between files and folders
- Allow selection of multiple files/folders in a single input, specifically for
selection purposes
