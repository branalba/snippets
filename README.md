My repository of template starter projects and commonly used functions and
simple applications that I use across my software projects.

## Repository Guide

The repo is organized by programming language.

### Python

- PythonStarter: a template I used for almost all newly created python projects,
incl. a scalable application structure and a setup.py script. The main.py source
file also features the building blocks for a CLI interface using the Click
module,  which I make use of in almost all of my scripts and applications.
